# c-nostdlib-assembly

We define own _start point without using glibc runtime library using **ASM**.

```bash
$ gcc asm.c -o asm -nostdlib
```

This program dates back to probably 2019.
I remember getting help from several people to prepare this. But unfortunately I do not remember their names.

Thanks
